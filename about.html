                    I'm Claire Crawford - FREESPIRITED DESIGNER AND SELF PROCLAIMED
                    TECH-NERD. I craft
                    unique, intuitive websites to empower women and help to bring
                    their small-business dream to
                    fruition.
                </p>

                <p class="shorter_p_about_info">
                    I was somewhat of a late bloomer when it came to finding my
                    calling. For many years my focus was on raising my children.
                    I also ran a small, home-based business selling my art. It
                    was during this time that I created my first website - not
                    so much out of want than out of necessity (I commissioned a
                    web designer on two occasions, with disappointing
                    results). Thus began my love affair with web development.
                    The pairing of artistic design with the challenging
                    technical aspects of coding a webpage seemed to tick off all
                    the major boxes for "dream job". I was still busy raising
                    children so building a new career seemed an unrealistic
                    goal.
                </p>

                <p class="shorter_p_about_info">
                    Fast forward several years. Now, with children grown, I made
                    the decision to go back to college. I'd rather eat a dirt
                    sandwich than do that again (I'm laughing but, seriously,
                    NO. I love to learn but too introverted for the college
                    environment). However, I learned a ton, earned a degree in
                    Computer Information/Web Development and even
                    pulled off a 4.0 GPA ... #personalgoal
                </p>

                <p class="second_to_last_p_about_info">
                    I've never been more certain that I'm doing what I'm meant
                    to do. Crafting impactful websites for enterprising women
                    isn't just outrageously enjoyable for me; It fulfills my
                    heart's longing for a career that supports and empowers the
                    dreams of others. What could be better than that, right?

                    Whenever asked about future goals, my mind immediately goes
                    to "empower women". I knew that, somehow, I wanted to be
                    involved in helping other women reach their personal and
                    professional goals - to be a supportive contributor to
                    their story and a witness to phenomenal women finding
                    their divine power, seeing their worth, believing in their
                    ability to overcome, to grow, to SHINE. <img

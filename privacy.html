            <h3>Last Updated: 24 March 2018</h3>
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>This Policy applies to the collection, processing, use, disclosure and transfer of data and information
                about individuals by Cheryl Crawford, d/b/a Travel Amore ("Travel Amore"). As such and among other
                things, Travel Amore has elected to voluntarily participate in the European Union ("EU")-US Privacy
                Shield (the "Privacy Shield") and to certify its adherence to the Privacy Shield and its Principles,
                including the Supplemental Principles (collectively, the "Principles"). As such it has agreed to subject
                its compliance to the Privacy Shield and its Principles to the full breadth of current regulatory
                enforcement of the United States Department of Transportation and the United States Federal Trade
                Commission as well as any other statutory body empowered to enforce compliance with the Privacy Shield
                and its Principles. This includes the European Directive on Data Protection. Dir 95/45/EC and the
                Privacy and Electronic Directive Dir. 2002/58/EC.</p>
            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>As set forth above, various national and international laws and regulations protect the rights of
                individuals in connection with data relating to them. These rights include the right of a person to make
                sure that data about them is accurate, is processed fairly and lawfully, is kept secure and is only
                disclosed to others with their consent under agreed circumstances.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this Policy is to document Travel Amore' continuing commitment to ensuring that the aims
                of national and international laws and regulations on data protection, including but not limited to
                those set forth above, are respected and that the collection, processing, use and disclosure of data by
                Travel Amore is compliant with those laws and regulations.</p>
            <p>As a global travel management company, Travel Amore, among other things, receives data from within and
                outside the United States, including but not limited to the EU and delivers that data to its customers
                and other third parties in various formats; all at the request of and by agreement with its customers.
            </p>
            <h4>Scope of this Policy</h4>
            <p>This Policy applies to Travel Amore' operations throughout the world. Where local laws and regulations
                which go beyond the scope of this Policy apply to the collection, processing, use and disclosure of
                data, then these may be included in an appendix to this Policy, which will specify the location to which
                it applies. In that location, the additional provisions of the relevant appendix will be observed along
                with all of the other provisions of the Policy.</p>
            <h4>Definitions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>"Personal Data" includes data that relates to a person and this person must be identifiable. The
                    identification can be direct (for example, by reference to the person's name) or indirect (for
                    example, by reference to a unique number that relates only to them).</li>
                <li>"Processing" of Personal Data means any operation or set of operations that is performed upon
                    Personal Data, whether or not by automated means.</li>
                <li> "Controller" means a person or organization which, along or jointly with others, determines the
                    purposes and means of the Processing of Personal Data. "Data Exporter" means the Controller who
                    transfers Personal Data.</li>
                <li> "Data Importer" means the Controller or Processor who agrees to receive data from the Data Exporter
                    for Processing.</li>
                <li> "Data Processor" means a person or organization that Processes Personal Data on behalf of a
                    Controller.</li>
                <li> "Data Subject" means the individual whose Personal Data is being Processed.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Adherence to Primary Principles of Privacy Shield</h4>
            <h5>Notice, Choice and Accountability for Onward Transfer</h5>
            <p>Travel Amore will inform its customers and business partners (e.g., vendors and other third parties) that
                it participates in the Privacy Shield. It will provide such notice in a variety of manners as may be
                appropriate, such as, language in its contracts with customers, clear notification on its website
                (https://Travel Amore.github.io/privacy-policy.html), and a specific link to this policy that can be
                easily found. Travel Amore personal data may include, but is not limited to, information such as name,
                address, age, marital status, medical conditions, passport and visa information and corporate data.</p>
            <p>Travel Amore is committed to adhere to principles laid in this policy, all personal data received from
                the EU in reliance on the Privacy Shield. To contact Travel Amore for any inquiries or complaints, send
                an email to support@TravelAmore.com. Travel Amore will respond within forty-five (45) calendar days of
                such request.</p>
            <p>Travel Amore provides travel management services and reporting to corporate clients (typically, a Data
                Controller). In order to provide these services, Travel Amore requires Personal Data regarding persons
                authorized to travel for the client (the "Data Subjects") hereinafter referred to as the "Traveler" or
                "Travelers". This data may be collected from the Traveler, from the client, or from other sources such
                as travel agents. In order to complete travel arrangements requested by a Traveler, Travel Amore
                typically provides Personal Data to one of the global distribution systems or an internet booking
                engine. This data may include, but is not limited to, information such as name, address, age, marital
                status, medical conditions, passport and visa information and corporate data.</p>
            <p>Global distribution systems fulfill the travel arrangements requested through specific travel suppliers,
                such as airlines, hotels and rental car agencies. Travel Amore then confirms the completed travel
                arrangements and itinerary to the Traveler and the costs. Travel Amore does not exercise any control
                over the use of personal information transmitted using global distribution systems or other travel
                suppliers. As of the Effective Date, Travel Amore provides Traveler travel information to iJET/ISOS for
                travel risk management as well as to DataFlex for credit card reconciliation. Otherwise, travel
                arrangements are shared only with the client for whom the Traveler works.</p>
            <h5>Rights of data subjects to obtain access to personal data. </h5>
            <p>Every Traveler about whom Travel Amore Processes Personal Data has a right to the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>to inquire whether or not Personal Data relating to him or her is being Processed by or on behalf of
                    Travel Amore, a customer of Travel Amore and/or a Controller;</li>
                <li>if Personal Data relating to him or her is being Processed by or on behalf of Travel Amore, to be
                    given the following information:
                    <ul>
                        <li>a description of the Personal Data relating to him or her;</li>
                        <li> the purposes for which that Personal Data is being or is to be Processed;</li>
                        <li> the identity of any third parties to whom the data is or may be disclosed, </li>
                        <li>and, in addition, the Traveler is entitled, upon written request, to be given a copy of the
                            relevant data in an intelligible form.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>There may be restrictions on the amount of information that can be disclosed if such disclosure would
                necessarily involve disclosing information about another person or entity.</p>
            <p>In the event an individual desires to limit the use and disclosure of their personal data, including
                requests to "opt-out" Individuals have the right:</p>
